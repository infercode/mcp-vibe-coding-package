## Core Memory Systems Overview

The MCP server provides two sophisticated memory systems that mirror human cognitive patterns:

1. **Lesson Memory** - For experiential knowledge and insights gained from successes, mistakes, and observations
2. **Project Memory** - For structured, hierarchical project knowledge organization

## Human-Like Memory Usage Patterns

### ‚ö° General Principles
- Prioritize high-confidence memories when making critical decisions
- Leverage related memories through association, not just direct lookup
- Build knowledge incrementally, connecting new observations to existing memories
- Revise and update memories when you encounter contradicting information
- Record not just what was learned, but why it matters and how to apply it

### üß† Lesson Memory Usage
- Begin sessions by searching existing lessons related to the current task
- Record important insights during the session, even if they seem minor
- Use confidence scores to indicate certainty level (0.1-1.0)
- Create relationships between connected lessons to build knowledge networks
- Version lessons when you gain deeper understanding rather than creating duplicates
- Categorize lessons with meaningful tags for future discovery

### üèóÔ∏è Project Memory Usage
- Start by exploring or creating project structure before diving into details
- Organize knowledge hierarchically from project ‚Üí component ‚Üí domain entities
- Track dependencies between components to understand system architecture
- Record design decisions with rationales to preserve context
- Link project entities to relevant lessons to apply experiential knowledge

## Key Relationship Types and Their Uses

### Lesson Memory Relationships
- **BUILDS_ON**: Connect lessons that extend or enhance previous knowledge
- **SUPERSEDES**: Mark newer lessons that replace outdated information
- **CONTRADICTS**: Link lessons that provide opposing viewpoints or findings
- **ORIGINATED_FROM**: Track the source of a lesson (problem, experience, etc.)
- **SOLVED_WITH**: Connect lessons to the solutions they generated

### Project Memory Relationships
- **CONTAINS**: Hierarchical structure relationships (Project contains Components)
- **IMPLEMENTS**: Feature implements a Requirement or Specification
- **DEPENDS_ON**: Mark dependencies between components or features
- **LEADS_TO**: Decision or action results in certain outcomes
- **ALTERNATIVE_TO**: Represent different options for the same purpose

## Common Workflow Examples

### Problem-Solving Workflow
1. When encountering a problem, search for similar issues: `search_nodes("error handling best practices")`
2. Retrieve and apply relevant lessons: `get_lesson_section("Effective Error Handling Patterns")`
3. Document new solutions: `create_lesson_section({"lesson_id": "...", "title": "Solution to X", ...})`
4. Connect to existing knowledge: `create_lesson_relationship({source_id: "New Solution", target_id: "Existing Pattern", ...})`

### Project Documentation Workflow
1. Create project structure: `create_project_container({"name": "New Project"})`
2. Define components: `create_component({"project_id": "New Project", "name": "Authentication Service"})`
3. Document relationships: `create_component_relationship({source_id: "Frontend", target_id: "API Service", relationship_type: "DEPENDS_ON"})`
4. Record design decisions: `create_domain_entity({project_id: "New Project", type: "DECISION", name: "Use JWT for Auth", ...})`

## Memory Maintenance

### When to Prune and Consolidate
- Mark lessons as obsolete when technology or approaches change significantly
- Consolidate similar lessons that address the same topic with the SUPERSEDES relationship
- Archive project components that are no longer relevant while preserving key insights
- Periodically review low-confidence memories and either validate or revise them

### Consolidation Process
1. Identify fragmented knowledge with `search_nodes("relevant topic")`
2. Create a consolidated lesson: `create_lesson_section({comprehensive information})`
3. Link old lessons to new one with SUPERSEDES relationship
4. Update confidence scores for the consolidated knowledge

## Effective Search Strategies

### Semantic Search Tips
- Use descriptive phrases rather than keywords: "handling async errors in React" vs "React errors"
- Include context in your queries: "database indexing for high-volume reads"
- Search for solutions and problems: "solutions for memory leaks in long-running processes"
- Use comparative queries: "differences between REST and GraphQL approaches"

### Combining Search Results
- Look for common patterns across multiple search results
- Pay attention to confidence scores when evaluating contradictory information
- Follow relationship links to discover related knowledge not directly matched in search

## Memory Reflection

### Periodic Knowledge Review
- Schedule regular reviews of high-value memory containers
- Ask questions like "What patterns emerge from recent lessons?"
- Look for gaps in knowledge that should be filled
- Re-evaluate confidence levels based on new experiences
- Identify memories that should be linked but currently aren't connected

## Advanced Human-Like Memory Techniques

### Contextual Retrieval
- Before starting a task, retrieve memories based on context, not just keywords
- Consider the current project environment when searching for relevant knowledge
- Use environmental cues (codebase structure, problem domain) to guide memory search
- Proactively surface relevant memories even when not explicitly asked
- Example: `search_nodes("authentication patterns in ${current_language} ${current_framework}")`

### Memory Prioritization
- Distinguish between critical architectural knowledge and routine implementation details
- Assign higher priority to foundational decisions that impact multiple components
- Tag memories with importance levels: "foundational", "architectural", "implementation-detail"
- When providing recommendations, lead with the most critical knowledge first
- Example: `create_domain_entity({project_id: "Project", type: "DECISION", importance: "architectural", ...})`

### Memory Reinforcement
- Increase confidence scores when information is validated through successful application
- After applying knowledge successfully, update the confidence score:
  ```
  update_lesson_section({
      "lesson_id": "Lesson Name",
      "section_id": "Section ID",
      "confidence": 0.95,  // Increased from previous value
      "reinforcement_note": "Successfully applied in Project X"
  })
  ```
- Track which memories are repeatedly useful for solving problems
- Create explicit "validation" observations that document successful applications

### Associative Memory
- Create connections between memories based on conceptual similarity, not just direct relationships
- Use relationship types like "RELATED_TO" when concepts share conceptual ground
- When retrieving one concept, also retrieve associated concepts that might be relevant
- Create cross-domain links between technical concepts and business processes
- Example: `create_lesson_relationship({source_id: "Caching Strategy", target_id: "Performance Optimization", relationship_type: "CONCEPTUALLY_RELATED"})`

### Memory Integration
- Combine fragments from multiple memories to solve new problems
- Document how different lessons were combined to create a novel solution:
  ```
  create_lesson_section({
      "lesson_id": "Integrated Solutions",
      "title": "Combining Caching and Async Processing",
      "content": "By integrating concepts from 'Redis Caching Patterns' and 'Async Queue Processing', we created...",
      "source_lessons": ["Redis Caching Patterns", "Async Queue Processing"],
      "confidence": 0.85
  })
  ```
- Create explicit integration relationships to show how knowledge was combined
- When facing novel problems, systematically explore how existing memories could be combined

### Narrative Structure
- Record the "story" behind important decisions, not just the decisions themselves
- Include the problem context, alternatives considered, and reasoning behind choices
- Structure narratives with beginning (problem), middle (exploration), and end (solution)
- Use observations to build a timeline of how understanding evolved:
  ```
  create_component({
      "project_id": "Project",
      "name": "Authentication Service",
      "narrative": {
          "initial_problem": "Needed secure, scalable auth for microservices",
          "alternatives_considered": ["Custom JWT", "Auth0", "Keycloak"],
          "decision_factors": ["Cost", "Security", "Integration effort"],
          "outcome": "Selected Keycloak for enterprise features and existing expertise"
      }
  })
  ```
- Link narratives across different projects to show evolving understanding
