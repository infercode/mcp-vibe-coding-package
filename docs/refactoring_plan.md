```

## Phase 1: Base Functionality Extraction

### 1.1. Create Base Manager

Extract Neo4j connection management and base functionality to `graph_memory/base_manager.py`:

- Connection initialization
- Connection pooling
- Connection testing and retry logic
- Safe query execution
- Vector index setup
- Close connection

### 1.2. Extract Entity, Relation, Observation Managers

Create separate managers for core operations:

- **Entity Manager**: Create, read, update, delete entity operations
- **Relation Manager**: Create, read, update, delete relationship operations
- **Observation Manager**: Create, read, update, delete observation operations
- **Search Manager**: Basic and semantic search operations

### 1.3. Extract Embedding Adapter

Create adapter interface to embedding functionality:

- Move embedding generation methods to `graph_memory/embedding_adapter.py`
- Create clean interface for entity-to-embedding conversion
- Define standardized error handling

## Phase 2: Memory System Implementation

### 2.1. Implement Lesson Memory System

Move lesson memory functionality to `lesson_memory/` directory:

- LessonContainer: Global container for lessons
- LessonEntity: CRUD operations for lesson entities
- LessonRelation: Specialized relationship types
- LessonObservation: Structured observation types
- EvolutionTracker: Knowledge evolution tracking
- Consolidation: Memory consolidation functions

### 2.2. Implement Project Memory System

Move project memory functionality to `project_memory/` directory:

- ProjectContainer: Project container operations
- DomainManager: Domain entity operations
- ComponentManager: Component entity operations
- FeatureManager: Feature entity operations
- DecisionManager: Decision entity operations
- EvolutionTracker: Project entity evolution tracking
- KnowledgeTransfer: Cross-project knowledge transfer

## Phase 3: Integration and API Compatibility

### 3.1. Create Facade Class

Create `GraphMemoryManager` facade that maintains original API:

```python
# src/graph_memory/__init__.py
from src.graph_memory.base_manager import BaseManager
from src.graph_memory.entity_manager import EntityManager
from src.graph_memory.relation_manager import RelationManager
from src.graph_memory.observation_manager import ObservationManager
from src.graph_memory.search_manager import SearchManager

from src.lesson_memory import LessonMemoryManager
from src.project_memory import ProjectMemoryManager

class GraphMemoryManager:
    """Facade to maintain backward compatibility with original API."""
    
    def __init__(self, logger=None):
        # Initialize components
        self.base_manager = BaseManager(logger)
        self.entity_manager = EntityManager(self.base_manager)
        self.relation_manager = RelationManager(self.base_manager)
        self.observation_manager = ObservationManager(self.base_manager)
        self.search_manager = SearchManager(self.base_manager)
        self.lesson_memory = LessonMemoryManager(self.base_manager)
        self.project_memory = ProjectMemoryManager(self.base_manager)
        
    # Implement or delegate all existing methods to maintain API compatibility
    def initialize(self):
        return self.base_manager.initialize()
    
    def create_entities(self, entities):
        return self.entity_manager.create_entities(entities)
    
    # ...other methods...
```

### 3.2. Update MCP Tool Handlers

Update handlers in `main.py` to use the new API:

- Use the facade class to maintain compatibility
- Gradually transition to direct use of specialized managers

## Phase 4: Testing and Validation

### 4.1. Create Unit Tests

Develop comprehensive unit tests for each extracted module:

- Base manager connection tests
- Entity CRUD operation tests
- Relation operation tests
- Observation operation tests
- Search functionality tests

### 4.2. Create Integration Tests

Create integration tests to ensure system works end-to-end:

- Full Lesson Memory system tests
- Full Project Memory system tests
- MCP interface tests

### 4.3. Benchmark Performance

Compare performance before and after refactoring:

- Query response times
- Memory usage
- Connection management efficiency

## Phase 5: Documentation and Cleanup

### 5.1. Update Documentation

- Update inline code documentation
- Create module-level documentation
- Update API reference documentation

### 5.2. Remove Deprecated Code

- Remove redundant code
- Clean up obsolete functions
- Fix any issues identified during testing

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Progressive Extraction**: Refactor one module at a time
2. **Test-Driven Approach**: Write tests before implementing each module
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain original API throughout refactoring
4. **Feature Parity**: Ensure no functionality is lost during refactoring
5. **Code Review**: Peer review each module extraction
6. **API Enhancement**: Consider API improvements after refactoring is complete
