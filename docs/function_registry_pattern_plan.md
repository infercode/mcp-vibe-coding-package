- IDE Integration Optimizations: [COMPLETED] - Implemented IDE-friendly documentation, tool hints, category-based meta-tools, and export capabilities
- Agent Guidance System: [COMPLETED] - Implemented function recommendation engine, usage pattern detection, and complex operation helpers

#### Phase 5: Monitoring and Feedback
- **Usage Analytics**: [SKIPPED] - Determined to be non-essential for core functionality
- **Feedback Mechanism**: [COMPLETED] - Enables collecting and processing agent feedback to improve functions
- **Health and Diagnostics**: [COMPLETED] - Provides system health monitoring, diagnostics, and self-healing capabilities

### Latest Updates
- [2025-04-15] **Phase 5: Health and Diagnostics and Feedback Mechanism** [COMPLETED]
Implemented the remaining components of Phase 5. The Health and Diagnostics module provides system health monitoring, diagnostics tools, and self-healing capabilities to ensure reliability. The Feedback Mechanism enables agents to submit feedback on functions, generates improvement suggestions, and creates optimization recommendations. These components transform the Function Registry into a self-improving system that can maintain optimal performance. With these additions, all planned non-skipped components are now complete.

- [2025-04-14] **Phase 5: Usage Analytics** [SKIPPED]
After evaluation, decided to skip the Usage Analytics component as it was determined to be non-essential for core functionality. Will focus on implementing the Health and Diagnostics and Feedback Mechanism components instead, which provide more immediate value for system reliability and continuous improvement.
