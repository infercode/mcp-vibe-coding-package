# PR: Neo4j Query Parameter Validation Implementation

## Summary

This PR implements comprehensive Neo4j query parameter validation using Pydantic models to enhance type safety, security, and reliability of database operations. The implementation provides utilities for validating and sanitizing query parameters, building complex queries with validation, and safely executing them with proper error handling.

## Changes

1. **New Models and Utilities:**
   - Added Pydantic models for Neo4j queries and parameters in `src/models/neo4j_queries.py`
   - Created utility functions for query validation in `src/utils/neo4j_query_utils.py`
   - Implemented security checks to prevent unsafe operations

2. **Example Implementation:**
   - Added an example script in `src/examples/neo4j_query_validation_example.py`
   - Demonstrated parameter validation, query building, and security features

3. **Documentation:**
   - Created integration guide in `docs/neo4j_query_validation_integration.md`
   - Updated Pydantic implementation plan to reflect completed work

## Features

### 1. Parameter Validation
- Type validation for query parameters
- Serialization compatibility checks
- Parameter sanitization for Neo4j compatibility

### 2. Query Building
- Structured approach to building complex Cypher queries
- Support for nodes, relationships, and path patterns
- Type-safe query construction

### 3. Security Enhancements
- Detection of destructive operations in read-only contexts
- Prevention of query injection attacks
- Validation of query structure

## Integration Strategy

The PR includes an integration guide that outlines a phased approach to adopting these validation utilities:

1. Start with parameter validation for high-risk operations
2. Add query validation to critical paths
3. Gradually replace direct query execution with validated execution
4. Refactor complex queries using the QueryBuilder pattern

## Testing

The implementation includes examples that demonstrate correct functionality and error handling. 
Additional unit and integration tests are recommended as follow-up work.

## Next Steps

1. Add unit tests for the validation utilities
2. Integrate validation with existing manager classes
3. Update documentation for developers
